Admin UI: migrate to TanStack Router with file-based routes, adopt the shadcn `sidebar-08` inset layout (collapsible sidebar, header breadcrumb, user menu), move global settings (pricing, appearance, account) into a `sidebar-13` settings dialog opened with `?settings=`, replace the flat per-row buttons in tables with a dropdown menu (API keys are now a table too), and add a usage chart (requests, tokens or cost over time) on the Usage and Overview pages. Server: `GET /admin/usage/timeline` returns usage bucketed by `bucket_ms`.
